# Car-Price-Prediction
### Building the Linear regression Model from scratch

Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset

### Requirements
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Project Plan
1. Data preparation
2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
3. Use linear regression for price prediction (MSRP â€“ Manufacturer suggested retail price)
4. Understand the internals of linear regression
5. Evaluating the model with RMSE (root mean squared error)
6. Feature Engineering (creating new features)
7. Regularization
8. Using the model
